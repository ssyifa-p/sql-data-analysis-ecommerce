This project contains a collection of SQL queries intended to get insights from the data. Using BigQuery, I analyzed two primary datasets: a Shopping Cart Database and the public TheLook E-Commerce dataset. The goal was to extract actionable insights regarding sales performance, inventory management, and logistics efficiency.
